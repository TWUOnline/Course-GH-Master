## Academic Integrity

Appropriate academic conduct requires that you complete your assessments independently, honestly, and without misrepresentation or plagiarism. Typically, plagiarism occurs in three forms: when a writer uses someone's exact words or ideas as if they were her/his own, paraphrases someone's ideas without acknowledgement or identifying the source, or simply does not include the proper citations.

Be sure to cite all sources of direct quotations and borrowed ideas. If you do not, you could fail your assignments and, potentially, the course.

Each assessment is viewed individually for academic integrity. Please be aware, should you choose to submit multiple assignments at the same time and if an academic integrity violation is discovered in more than one of those assignments, that each assignment submission will be viewed as a separate offence and sanctions will be applied accordingly.

**Note:** Citing facts, statistics, or other illustrative materials deemed to be common knowledge is not considered to be plagiarism.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you are fully familiar with the "Forms of Academic Dishonesty" section of the TRU Student Academic Integrity policy available at [http://www.tru.ca/\_\_shared/assets/ed05-05657.pdf](http://www.tru.ca/__shared/assets/ed05-05657.pdf). [Insert details]

# Strategies for Success

In some ways, taking a course through distance education is different from learning in a face-to-face classroom. For example, distance education often requires a high level of independent learning and uses of a variety of digital communication technologies. The following sections provide some suggestions that can assist your progress through the course.

## Familiarize yourself with the course materials

After you have read this Course Guide, review the other course materials so you know what is expected and you can plan your coursework time effectively.

## Review the learning outcomes as you complete each module

As you complete each unit, review the learning outcomes to ensure you have achieved them. If you feel unsure about your ability to meet any of these outcomes, review the relevant study material and/or consult your instructor.

## Read, view, and listen actively and critically

As you read, keep a pen (or electronic note-taking device) handy. If you make careful notes on key ideas and jot down the page numbers of essential passages, you can save yourself hours of searching for references when you complete your assessments. Your notes also will be useful for developing contributions to online discussions and for when you prepare for exams. Develop your skills to evaluate what you read. Do the facts makes sense? Is the evidence valid? Do you agree with an argument? What are the alternative points of view? Your answers to these questions will help you to develop informed opinions about your readings.

## Complete all learning activities as if they were being graded

This course has a number of learning activities that provide you with opportunities to explore topics related to your course materials. Although some of these activities may be ungraded, they are designed to help you build the skills you need to complete your assessments successfully.

## Participate actively in the online discussions [For paced course]

In a paced online course, it is important to communicate with your fellow learners and instructor on a regular basis. Participating in a learning community provides opportunities for support, access to a variety of individual viewpoints, and stimulation of new ideas, all of which can contribute to your learning success. Use the discussions as a way to reflect on, clarify, and communicate your perspectives on the course learning materials.

## Appreciate the diversity of your community of learners

In an online learning environment, student cohorts usually include learners from a diverse range of ages, cultural backgrounds, and geographical home communities. Diversity and the variety of individual perspectives of other students can provide you with many valuable learning experiences. Since by definition diversity includes difference, it is important for all participants in learning communities to be open to considering others' perspectives, values, and positions; and to communicate in a courteous, respectful way. Even though this does not mean you must always agree, part of academic discourse is considering opposing viewpoints and perspectives. Increasingly, employers seek out employees who are skilled at appreciating diversity and who can work collaboratively with those who have different experiences, perspectives, and values.

#  [Note to Production: Please locate the "What is a Journal" file in a folder on the. Do not include this information in the Course Guide.]

# What is a Reflective Learning Journal?

In this course, you are encouraged to keep a reflective learning journal. We think the act of writing your thoughts and reflections on the course material in your own words will assist you with learning the course content. Following are some ideas relating to what you can write about in your learning journal:

- Do you agree or disagree with a concept or an idea in the course material. Reflect on why or why not?
- Which types of questions do you find difficult to answer? Why?
- Has any of the course material changed or challenged your preconceptions or understanding of certain concepts?
- How can you apply some of the concepts you have learned?
- Which parts of the course are more interesting or exciting for you to learn?

Remember, a journal is a personal expression of who you are, so you choose how it looks. Everyone has different qualities that make them unique, so a journal can take many different forms. It can be an electronic record, a sketchbook, a notebook, a binder, a video or audio recording, or a combination of some or all of these forms. An "entry" can even include such things as a written reflections, drawings, doodles, pictures, poems, lyrics, clippings, quotes, photographs, videos, or even the description of a dream. The journal also can contain very practical components such as a personal glossary for terms and main concepts, which will help you prepare for assignments and exams.

Spend some time every day recording in your journal. You can choose the time of day, the frequency, and the amount of time. You may choose to carry it with you and make notes, draw, or tape record your thoughts throughout the day. You may choose to reflect each morning or each evening. Experiment until you find the rhythm that best suits your personal style.

If you have never kept a journal before, begin by simply writing down anything that concerns you about the topic. Alternatively, you may find it easier to start your journal by making lists, writing key words, or drawing images. Sometimes, using nonlinear processes can free you from "writer's block." The more you record, the easier it will become, and you may find you look forward to keeping your reflective journal.

Remember, keeping a journal of this type is a progressive experience, and what you express in it will also provide some direction for future entries. If you want to learn more about journaling, a number of resources are available through the library, or your Open Learning Faculty Member can provide advice.

# Sending Your Assignment to Your Open Learning Faculty Member

As soon as you have completed an assignment, save your document on your computer and then send a copy to your Open Learning Faculty Member for marking.

Be sure to include your name, the course code, assignment number, and the date of submission on the title page of your assignments, so they can be easily identified, and you get credit for all your work. Use headers in the body of your written assignments to make sure all components of your assignments are clearly identified (course code, your surname, assignment number, date [day, month, year]).

Name your assignment file as follows: course number\_your surname\_assignment number\_date. For example, if your name is Jan Martin and you are submitting Assignment 2, name your file: ENGL1061\_Martin\_Assignment2\_21July2017.
